The goal will be to analyze FitBit data from my Charge 5 in order to gain further insights into my health and fitness. I have loaded the data into the repo as a combination of CSV and JSON files. The data is stored in the MyFitbitData/FadiE directory. It is further broken down into several subdirectories, each of which contains data for a different type of FitBit data.
